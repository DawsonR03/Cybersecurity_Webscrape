# Vulnerability Scanner Reports

This directory contains HTML reports generated by the Cybersecurity Vulnerability Scanner. The scanner can automatically generate these reports to provide a human-readable summary of scan results.

## Report Features

- Visual summary of scan results
- Lists of discovered vulnerabilities, assets, and threats
- Risk level indicators with color coding
- Detailed information about each finding
- Time-stamped scan information

## Generating Reports

To generate a report after scanning, run the scanner with the `--report` flag:

```bash
python scrape.py --report
```

Or to generate a report from existing scan data:

```bash
python scrape.py --report-only
```

## Report Structure

Each report contains:

1. **Summary Section**: Overview of the scan statistics
2. **Vulnerabilities**: List of security vulnerabilities found
3. **Assets**: List of identified assets
4. **Threats**: List of detected threats

## Example Report

The `scan_report.html` file provides an example of the report format. Open it in any web browser to view.

## Customizing Reports

You can customize the report template by modifying the `generate_report` function in `scrape.py`. The report uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it can be customized to meet your specific requirements.

## Sharing Reports

These HTML reports can be:
- Emailed to stakeholders
- Uploaded to a web server
- Converted to PDF for archiving
- Included in compliance documentation

## Automated Reporting

For automated reporting, you can set up a cron job to run the scanner with the report flag at regular intervals. For example, to generate a report daily:

```bash
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/scanner && python scrape.py --once --report
```
